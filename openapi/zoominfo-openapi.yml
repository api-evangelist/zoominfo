        values using the [Lookup](#efe7b4b8-1ef2-4fcd-a20f-9da68f6b2055)
        endpoints.

        Use this endpoint to match contact information based on [input
        values](#dbaf31cd-0f7a-4bf3-b6c1-077f3c31f2df) and return the desired
        output fields in the response. Use [Contact Enrich
        Outputs](#28b47784-3186-4fc4-af91-12e6bc6fb31a) to retrieve the list of
        available output fields.


        **Input combinations**


        To match a contact, you must use one of the following combinations of
        parameters to construct your input:


        - `personId` OR `emailAddress` OR `hashedEmail` OR `phone`. Because
        these values are unique to a single person, you can use any one of these
        values to search without providing any additional parameters. You can
        optionally combine one of these values with a `companyId`/`companyName`.
            
        - `firstName` AND `lastName` AND `companyId`/`companyName`. Combining
        these values effectively results in a unique person.
            
        - `fullName` AND `companyId`/`companyName`. Combining these values
        effectively results in a unique person.
            

        **Maximum inputs per request**


        You can input a maximum of 25 contacts in a single enrich request,
        returning the equivalent number of matching records. See the endpoint
        examples for how to build queries using multiple inputs.


        **Required fields**


        You can specify a list of required fields for each record returned. This
        supports all output fields and can be used as a comma-separated list.
        See the "Enrich contacts using required fields" example provided with
        this endpoint for sample JSON used for the request.

        Use this endpoint to match company information based on [input
        values](#d305402c-33d1-488c-8b8f-b5b079868a61) and return the desired
        [output fields](#58b47522-753a-4104-a0c6-454adf4b6a1d) in the response.


        **Maximum inputs per request**


        You can input a maximum of 25 companies in a single enrich request,
        returning the equivalent number of matching records. See the endpoint
        examples for how to build queries using multiple inputs.


        **Declaring desired output**


        You must explicitly list the desired output fields in your request. For
        example, a simple request might look like this:


        ```

        {
            "matchCompanyInput": [
                {
                    "address": {
                        "zi_c_street": "805 Broadway St",
                        "zi_c_state": "Washington",
                        "zi_c_city": "Vancouver",
                        "zi_c_zip": "98660",
                        "zi_c_country": "United States"
                    },
                    "phone": {
                        "zi_c_phone": "+1 3607836800",
                        "zi_c_country": "United States"
                    },
                    "zi_c_location_id": 2079041960,
                    "zi_c_url": "zoomInfo.com",
                    "zi_c_name": "zoomInfo"
                }
            ],
            "outputFields": [
                "zi_c_location_id",
                "zi_es_ecid",
                "zi_es_location_id",
                "zi_c_is_hq",
                "zi_c_tier_grade",
                "zi_c_name",
                "zi_c_name_display",
                "zi_c_legal_entity_type",
                "zi_c_url",
                "zi_c_street",
                "zi_c_street_2",
                "zi_c_city",
                "zi_c_state",
                "zi_c_zip",
                "zi_c_country"
           ]
        }

         ```

        To keep the response data clean and unambiguous, if there is no data for
        a requested field, or it is NULL/EMPTY, the API will not return the
        field in the response.


        **Response status codes and error handling**


        This endpoint supports up to 25 inputs per request and will return a
        HTTP status code in the response indicating a 200, 400 or 5xx status.


        | Code | Meaning |

        | --- | --- |

        | 200 | Request inputs are acceptable. The API can return a successful
        match or no match. |

        | 400 | Indicates an error in the request input. |

        | 5xx | Indicates a server-side error. Retry the request or contact
        ZoomInfo Support if the issue persists. |


        When a request includes multiple companies, the following will occur:


        - If at least 1 input succeeds in a request containing multiple inputs
        (up to the limit of 25), a 200 HTTP status code will be returned.

        - If none of the inputs succeed and the request includes only a
        combination of bad inputs and internal errors, the API will return a 400
        HTTP status code.

        - If all inputs fail due to a server-side error, the response body of
        all of the input will return a status code of 500.
            

        **Input params**


        See the examples for how to structure your request. You must explicitly
        list the desired output fields in your request. See the examples
        included with this endpoint for how to structure a request.

                              Trello is a web-based project management
                              application originally made by Fog Creek Software
                              in 2011, that was spun out to form the basis of a
                              separate company in 2014 and later sold to
                              Atlassian in January 2017. Trello is a
                              collaboration tool that organizes your projects
                              into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you
                              what's being worked on, who's working on what, and
                              where something is in a process

        how recent content consumption compares to a historical baseline.

        - **Audience Strength** - Indicates the size of the group at the company
        conducting research in this topic.

        Use this endpoint to create a webhook.


        **About enabling a webhook**


        When creating a webhook, we recommend initially setting the `enabled`
        parameter to `false` so that you can ensure that:


        - Your target URL is accessible using the [Validate Target
        URL](#5fabb9e4-aff2-4651-8404-8b061675eda0) endpoint.

        - You've established a validation method in your app for the webhook
        verification token that will be generated with this request.
            

        Once you've completed these tasks, you can activate the webhook using
        the [Update Webhook](#c853f6cd-10e7-4103-9896-19827c4c5a8a) endpoint,
        updating the webhook's `enabled` status to `true`.


        **Input params**


        | Parameter | DataType | Description |

        | --- | --- | --- |

        | title | String | Title for the webhook |

        | enabled | Boolean | Determines whether the webhook is initially
        enabled or disabled. |

        | targetUrl | String | Destination URL for the webhook data. Must be in
        `https://` format. |

        | subscriptions | ArrayList | Specify the `eventType` and `objectType`
        for the webhook. Also specify the `fullPayload` value (`true` for full
        payload, `false` for only changed attributes.)|


        **Output fields**


        | Field | Description |

        | --- | --- |

        | id | Unique ZoomInfo identifier for the webhook |

        | title | Title for the webhook |

        | enabled | Displays whether the webhook is enabled or disabled |

        | targetUrl | Destination URL for the webhook data |

        | createdDate | Timestamp for when the webhook was created |

        | verificationToken | Verification token generated when the webhook was
        created |

        | subscriptions | List of subscriptions. Each subscription includes the
        `createdDate`, `modifiedDate`, `eventType`, `objectType` and a unique
        `subscriptionId`. |

      summary: Update Webhook
      description: >-
        Use this endpoint to update an existing webhook, including its enabled
        status, target URL, and subscription details.


        Specify the webhook by appending the webhook `id` in the request URL.
        For example:


        `https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/213786430`


        When using the Update Webhook endpoint, values you provide in the JSON
        body of your request overwrite values in the existing webhook. Common
        scenarios for using this endpoint include the following.


        **Enable a webhook**


        As described in the [Create
        Webhook](#6cbb2c08-cb50-4b15-9a01-a2d0d3dabaa1) endpoint, we recommend
        initially configuring a new webhook as disabled so you can ensure the
        target URL is reachable, and the verification token is in place in your
        integrated app. Once these tasks are complete, you can use the Update
        Webhook endpoint to enable the webhook.


        For example, send a request specifying the webhook `id` in the URL to
        change the `enabled` value to `true`:


        Request URL:


        `https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/{webhook_id}`


        JSON body:


        ```

        {
            "enabled": true
        }


        ```


        **Update webhook subscription details**


        Example: Your webhook has a subscription with the `objectType` set to
        `Company`, you can change it to `Contact` using the Update Webhook
        endpoint.


        Request URL:


        `https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/{webhook_id}`


        JSON body:


        ```

        {
            "subscriptions": [
                {
                    "subscriptionId": "393093719",
                    "eventType": "Update",
                    "objectType": "Contact"
                }
            ]
        } 


        ```


        **Add a new objectType to a subscription**


        Example: Your webhook has a subscription that includes only the
        `Contact` `objectType`. You can add the `Company` `objectType` to the
        subscription.


        Request URL:


        `https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/{webhook_id}`


        JSON body:


        ```

        {
            "subscriptions": [
                {
                    "eventType": "Update",
                    "objectType": "Company"
                }
            ]
        } 


        ```


        **Delete a subscription**


        You can delete a subscription by simply sending the `subscriptionId` in
        your request without specifying any subscription parameters.


        Request URL:


        `https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/{webhook_id}`


        JSON body:


        ```

        {
            "subscriptions": [
                {
                    "subscriptionId": "836880237"
                }
            ]
        }


        ```

      summary: Generate Verification Token
      description: >-
        Use this endpoint to generate a new verification token for an existing
        webhook. 


        **Important**: When you generate a new token, the previous token is
        immediately revoked and becomes invalid. When updating a verification
        token for an active Webhook, ensure that you update the verification
        token immediately in your integrated app, as ZoomInfo will still attempt
        to send the data, but it will fail based on the mismatched tokens.


        Specify the webhook for which you want the token generated by appending
        the webhook `id` in the request URL. For example:
        `https://api.zoominfo.com/webhooks/213786430/token`

        Use Bulk Contact Search to retrieve contacts using valid query
        parameters. Your request can consist of the following parameters:


        | Parameter | Description |

        | --- | --- |

        | jobType | Can be `preview` (default) or `redeem` |

        | query | Can consist of valid input fields from the [Contact Search
        Inputs](#74630827-dd25-4b6a-bf72-f7cfeffd6c41) endpoint to retrieve the
        desired results. The following fields are currently not supported with
        Bulk Search: `sortOrder` and `sortBy`. |

        | outputFields | Required for the `redeem` job type only. Specify the
        desired output fields to return. See the [Contact Enrich
        Outputs](#28b47784-3186-4fc4-af91-12e6bc6fb31a) endpoint for the list of
        output fields you can request. The following fields are currently not
        supported as an output for Bulk Search: `companyDescriptionList`. |


        See the preview and redeem request examples for syntax.


        The expected output in all cases is a `jobId`. For example:


        ```

        {
           "jobId": "e97813aa0bcae7a66f2ea9e1b69a0da2057bbfd8"
        }


        ```


        See the [Bulk Job Status](#1f6246d0-fd13-4f63-b170-dda2fedd8322) and
        [Bulk Job Results](#5417ba88-096d-448a-b6cd-b930089c678d) endpoints for
        details on how to use the `jobId` to preview and return results.

        Use Bulk Company Search to retrieve companies using valid query
        parameters. Your request can consist of the following parameters:


        | Parameter | Description |

        | --- | --- |

        | jobType | Can be `preview` (default) or `redeem` |

        | query | Can consist of valid input fields from the [Company Search
        Inputs](#ffd4ccc6-09d1-4026-8c4f-863d02fd703e) endpoint to retrieve the
        desired results. The following fields are currently not supported with
        Bulk Search: `sortOrder` and `sortBy`. |

        | outputFields | Required for the `redeem` job type only. Specify the
        desired output fields to return. The following fields are currently not
        supported as an output for Bulk Search: `descriptionList`. |


        See the [Company Enrich Outputs](#d05239c3-2597-45f8-9384-f2dbd3518cfc)
        endpoint for the list of output fields you can request. |


        See the preview and redeem request examples for syntax.


        The expected output in all cases is a `jobId`. For example:


        ```

        {
           "jobId": "e97813aa0bcae7a66f2ea9e1b69a0da2057bbfd8"
        }


        ```


        See the [Bulk Job Status](#1f6246d0-fd13-4f63-b170-dda2fedd8322) and
        [Bulk Job Results](#5417ba88-096d-448a-b6cd-b930089c678d) endpoints for
        details on how to use the `jobId` to preview and return results.

        With Bulk Contact Enrich you can:


        *   Enrich up to 10K records in a single job

        *   Retrieve up to 500 results per page
            

        Use this endpoint to enrich contact information based on [input
        values](#dbaf31cd-0f7a-4bf3-b6c1-077f3c31f2df) and return the desired
        [output fields](#28b47784-3186-4fc4-af91-12e6bc6fb31a) in the response.


        **Note**: All output fields in the [Contact
        Enrich](#2b23b5a2-4074-419e-b01f-e63a6f5af77b) endpoint are supported,
        with the exception of `companyDescriptionList`.


        When you submit an enrich request, an asynchronous job is started, and a
        `job_id` is instantly returned. For example:


        ```

        {
           "jobId": "e97813aa0bcae7a66f2ea9e1b69a0da2057bbfd8"
        }


        ```


        You can use the `job_id` to check the status of the job and enrich
        results.

      summary: Bulk Company Enrich
      description: >-
        With Bulk Company Enrich you can:


        *   Enrich up to 10K records in a single Enrich job

        *   Retrieve up to 500 results per page
            

        Use this endpoint to enrich company information based on [input
        values](#7a915792-e8cd-4e3a-9f0e-c19b850be536) and return the desired
        [output fields](#d05239c3-2597-45f8-9384-f2dbd3518cfc) in the response.


        **Note**: All output fields in the [Company
        Enrich](#5fdf6e5e-f71e-4e1f-9807-0f8296094dcc) endpoint are supported,
        with the exception of `companyDescriptionList`.


        When you submit an enrich request, an asynchronous job is started, and a
        `job_id` is instantly returned. For example:


        ```

        {
           "jobId": "e97813aa0bcae7a66f2ea9e1b69a0da2057bbfd8"
        }


        ```


        You can use the `job_id` to check the status of the job and enrich
        results.


        See the [Bulk Job Status](#1f6246d0-fd13-4f63-b170-dda2fedd8322) and
        [Bulk Job Results](#5417ba88-096d-448a-b6cd-b930089c678d) endpoints for
        details on how to use the `jobId` to preview and return results.

    description: >-
      The ZoomInfo API authenticates client access requests using a JSON Web
      Token (JWT). A JWT is a string that is generated by the server for the
      client that can then be passed along in an HTTPS request.


      **Note**: The Authenticate endpoint is one method for authenticating with
      the ZoomInfo API with a username and password. For other methods that
      utilize public libraries for Java, Python, and NodeJS, see the
      'Authentication methods' section in the [ZoomInfo API
      introduction](#intro).


      To obtain the token, the client exchanges valid user credentials with the
      server which generates the token and provides it back to the client. An
      access token generally has a set expiration time after which a new token
      will need to be requested by the client.


      Use the Authenticate endpoint to pass valid ZoomInfo user credentials to
      the API. If authentication is successful, a JWT access token is provided
      in the response body.


      **Important: The token is good for 60 minutes from the time that the
      response was generated.**


      *   **Do not generate a new JWT with every call/request.**

      *   **As a best practice to keep the session active, refresh the JWT every
      55 minutes.**

  - name: Monitoring API/Webhooks
    description: >-
      ZoomInfo data is highly dynamic, with contacts, companies and related data
      being constantly updated in real-time in our database. Naturally, our
      clients want these changes to be delivered in real-time for the records
      they've already purchased using the ZoomInfo API - that's where webhooks
      come in.


      ## Why webhooks?


      Organizations with ZoomInfo API access use the API's endpoints to search
      for, export, and enrich records to their integrated applications. While
      you can regularly poll for updates to contact and company records you've
      already enriched using the API, manually querying the entire database is
      not the best use of your time. A more efficient method is to configure
      webhooks to automatically update you when there is a change to a record
      youve purchased. Once configured, Webhooks will listen for events you
      subscribe to and automatically send over all (or only relevant) updates
      securely to your application.


      ## Monitoring API/Webhooks basics


      Available to organizations with the Scaling API, the Monitoring API is a
      set of endpoints that allows for the configuration of webhooks
      subscriptions that specify:


      - **Webhook Title**: Name of the webhook.

      - **Subscription**: The events you are listening for, consisting of object
      types and event types.
          - **Object types**: The types of records you want to update. Supported object types are Contact and Company.
          - **Event types**: The events that trigger a webhook's response. Currently, the only supported event is Update.
      - **Changed attributes**: This is a JSON object that includes a list of
      fields that are changed as part of a payload.

      - **Payload types (full payload/changed attributes only)**:
          - A full payload (all fields for a contact or company, including changed attributes)
          - Only the changed attributes for a contact or company.
      - **Target URL**: The target URL to which the webhook JSON payloads are
      sent.

      - **Verification Token**: Signature token that will be part of the request
      we send to you.
          

      ## Securing the data transfer


      To secure communication between ZoomInfo and your app, a _verification
      token_ is generated when you create the webhook. When data is sent to your
      target URL using a POST request, this verification token will be included
      in the request header (_x-zoominfo-token_) and can be used in your app to
      authorize receipt of the data from ZoomInfo.


      The initial token is generated when you create a webhook. To maintain
      security for your webhook over time, you can periodically generate a new
      verification token using the [Generate Verification
      Token](#9cc75e99-622e-4aa2-b9a8-2d33d0ede2ed) webhook.


      ## Considerations


      Note the following considerations:


      - To use the Monitoring API/webhooks, you must have access to the Scaling
      API.

      - To subscribe to events, you must have already enriched at least one
      contact or company record using the API.

      - You will only receive updates on records that you've purchased using the
      API within the past 12 months.

      - The default payload type for company or contact updates is the full
      payload with changed attributes.
          
      - The maximum number of profiles delivered in a single webhook payload is
      25.
          

      ## Payload examples


      Here are examples of the POST requests your webhook's target URL will
      receive.


      For contact and company records, you can choose to receive a full payload
      of all possible fields for a record (including changed attributes), or a
      payload including only the changed attributes for a record.


      In either case (full or changed attributes only), contact and company
      records will always include the following fields to support mapping the
      profile:


      **Contacts**: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `email`


      **Companies**: `id`, `name`, and `website`


      The following examples are provided below:


      - Example 1: Contact record - full profile (default)

      - Example 2: Contact record - changed attributes only

      - Example 3: Company record - full profile (default)

      - Example 4: Company record - changed attributes only
          

      **Example 1: Contact record - full profile (default)**  

      Includes all output fields

  - name: Bulk
    description: >-
      Use the Bulk APIs to search, retrieve, and enrich large ZoomInfo company
      and contact datasets through asynchronous batch processes.


      With 20x more records than Contact and Company Search and 400x more
      records than the Contact and Company Enrich, you can leverage Bulk APIs
      for data ingestion and enrichment at scale.


      **Bulk Search API**


      With the Bulk Search API you can:


      *   Search for up to 200K records with a single search query

      *   Preview or redeem up to 500 records per page
          

      Two job types are available with the Bulk Search APIs:


      *   The Preview job type returns a company or contact search results
      preview to help identify records best suited for enrichment. Credits are
      not charged for the Preview job type.

      *   The Redeem job type enables data retrieval for ingestion, returning
      selected output fields for a given contact or company. A credit is charged
      for each unique record that is redeemed.
          

      When you submit a search request, an asynchronous job is started, and a
      job_id is instantly returned. You can use the job_id to check the status
      of the job and retrieve results.


      **Bulk Enrich API**


      With the Bulk Enrich API you can:


      *   Enrich up to 10K records in a single job

      *   Retrieve up to 500 results per page
          

      When you submit an enrich request, an asynchronous job is started, and a
      job_id is instantly returned. You can use the job_id to check the status
      of the job and enrich results.


      **Rate Limiting**


      *   You can have up to 5 "active" jobs (Jobs that are in progress are
      active jobs. Once a job is completed, you can proceed to creating another
      job)

      *   You can create up to 1 job per second

      *   Each job you create expires after 24 hours
  - name: WebSights API
    description: >-
      The Websights API identifies anonymous website traffic by resolving IP
      addresses (IPv4 & IPv6) to return company and ISP profiles and IP
      geolocation details.


      **Company vs. ISP response data**


      If the IP address belongs to a company, details about the company are
      returned including geolocation details. For example:


      ```

      "data": {
          "company": {
              "city": "Vancouver",
              "country": "United States",
              "employeeCount": 1300,
              "id": 344589814,
              "industries": [
                  "media.data",
                  "media",
                  "software"
              ],
              "name": "Zoom Information, Inc.",
              "revenue": 400000,
              "state": "Washington",
              "street": "805 Broadway St Suite 900",
              "ticker": "",
              "website": "www.zoominfo.com",
             "zipCode": "98660"
          },
          "geoLocation": {
              "location_long": -122.672,
              "location_lat": 45.627,
              "country_code": "US",
              "province": "Washington"
          }

      ```


      If the IP address belongs to an internet service provider (ISP), details
      about the ISP are returned including geolocation details. For example:


      ```
          "data": {
              "geoLocation": {
                  "location_long": -71.06616,
                  "location_lat": 42.45843,
                  "country_code": "US",
                  "province": "Massachusetts"
              },
              "ispInfo": {
                  "domain": "comcast.com",
                  "ip_hi_string": "73.143.255.255",
                  "ip_lo_string": "73.142.0.0",
                  "name": "Comcast Cable Communications, Inc.",
                  "type": "isp"
              }

      ```


      **Charging mechanism**


      Your account is provisioned with an allocated number of records that you
      can retrieve over a 1-year period. A record is either a company for which
      ZoomInfo has data, or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). If a query does
      not match a company or ISP, no record is charged.
